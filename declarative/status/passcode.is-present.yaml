  presence: required
  content: If 'true', a passcode is present on the device. If 'false', a passcode
    isn't present on the device. When a passcode is present, the specific attributes
    of the passcode, such as length or number of complex characters, aren't reported.
    Instead, use the 'passcode.is-compliant' status item to verify that the passcode
    complies with all passcode policies set on the device.

  title: Profile's URL.
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: |-
    The URL of the profile to download and install, which needs to start with 'https://', and must be hosted by the MDM server.
    If a user enrollment triggers this configuration, the system silently ignores any MDM 1 payloads in macOS where the User Enrollment Mode setting is 'forbidden'. In iOS and tvOS, the system rejects the entire profile.

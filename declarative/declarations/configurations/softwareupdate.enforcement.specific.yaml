payloadkeys:
- key: TargetOSVersion
  title: Target OS Version
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The target OS version to update the device to by the appropriate time.
    This is the OS version number, for example, '16.1'.
- key: TargetBuildVersion
  title: Target Build Version
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The target build version to update the device to by the appropriate time,
    for example, '20A242'. The system uses the build version for testing during seeding
    periods. The build version can include a supplemental version identifier, for
    example, '20A242a'. If the build version isn't consistent with the target OS version
    specified in the 'TargetOSVersion' key, the target OS version takes precedence.
- key: TargetLocalDateTime
  title: Target Local Date Time
  type: <string>
  presence: required
  content: The local date time value that specifies when to force install the software
    update. Use the format 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss', which is derived from RFC3339 but
    doesn't include a time zone offset. If the user doesn't trigger the software update
    before this time, the device force installs it.
- key: DetailsURL
  title: Details URL
  type: <string>
  presence: optional
  content: The URL of a web page that shows details that the organization provides
    about the enforced update.

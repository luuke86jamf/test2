  content: When a macOS (v10.11 and later) device is configured via DEP to enroll
    in an MDM server and the DEP profile has the await_device_configuration flag set
    to true, the AccountConfiguration command can be sent to the device to have it
    create the local administrator account (thereby skipping the page to create this
    account in Setup Assistant). This command can only be sent to a macOS device that
    is in the AwaitingConfiguration state.

    This specifies a freshness code which appears in the resulting attestation. The value can contain up to 32 bytes of data. If specified, 'Queries' needs to contain 'DevicePropertiesAttestation'.
    The MDM server can use this to prove that an attestation was recently generated. The system caches the most recently generated attestation on the device. If omitted or if the value matches the cached attestation, the system returns the cached attestation. To request a new attestation, provide a new freshness code. Requests for new attestations are rate limited. If it has been fewer than 7 days since the system generated an attestation, the device returns the cached attestation rather than generating a new one.
    Available in iOS 16 and later, macOS 14 and later, tvOS 16 and later, and watchOS 10 and later. See the DeviceInformation attestation hardware support note for hardware requirements.

      The key to get an attestation of the device's properties. Available in
      iOS 16 and later, macOS 14 and later, tvOS 16 and later, and watchOS 10 and
      later. See the DeviceInformation attestation hardware support note for hardware
      requirements.
      The value is an array of certificates in DER form that forms a certificate chain. The chain is rooted with the Apple CA 'Apple Enterprise Attestation Root CA'. The first array item is the leaf certificate. The leaf certificate contains custom OIDs describing a device. Which OIDs are present in the certificate depend on the OS version of the device and the type of enrollment. If Apple's attestation servers are unable to verify a device property it will provide a blank value, omit the OID entirely, or refuse to issue an attestation certificate.
      The following OIDs were introduced in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, tvOS 16, watchOS 9.l0, visionOS 1.0 and macOS 14.0:
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.1 serial number -- This is the serial number of the device. It is omitted if the enrollment is a User Enrollment.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.2 UDID  -- For a Mac this has the same value as the ProvisioningUDID key in the DeviceInformation response, and does not match the UDID used elsewhere in the MDM protocol. It is omitted if the enrollment is a User Enrollment.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.2 sepOS version  -- This is the version of the operating system running on the Secure Enclave at the time the attestation is generated. In most cases this matches the version of the main operating system.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.11.1 Freshness code  -- This is the freshness code. For an explanation of the expected value, see the DeviceAttestationNonce key in the DeviceInformation request. This may not match the requested freshness code if a cached attestation was returned.
      The following OIDs were introduced in iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, tvOS 17.2, watchOS 10.2, visionOS 1.l0, and macOS 14.2:
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.9.4 Software Update Device ID -- This is an identifier of the device model. It is expected to match the SoftwareUpdateDeviceID in the DeviceInformation response. This is the device identifier to use when looking up available OS updates through https://gdmf.apple.com/v2/pmv.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.1 OS Version -- This is the version of iOS, iPadOS or tvOS running on the device at the time the attestation is generated.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.10.3 LLB Version -- This is the version of the Low Level Bootloader firmware running on the device at the time the attestation is generated. For more information about the boot process, see the documentation of the boot process in the Apple Platform Security guide.
      The following OIDs were introduced in macOS 14.2:
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.1 System Integrity Protection (SIP) status -- This indicates whether SIP is enabled or disabled at the time the attestation is generated. 0 indicates enabled, 1 indicates disabled.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.2 Secure boot status -- This describes part of the configuration of the LocalPolicy at the time the attestation is generated. The possible values are 'Full Security', 'Reduced Security', or 'Permissive Security'. For a description of these values see the Apple Platform Security guide.
      * 1.2.840.113635.100.8.13.3 Third party kernel extensions allowed -- This indicates whether third party kernel extensions are allowed. A value of 0 indicates third party kernel extensions are not allowed. Any other value means that some kinds of third party kernel extensions are allowed.

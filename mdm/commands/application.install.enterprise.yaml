      for SHA-256 hashes.
- key: ManifestURL

    If 'true', install the app as a managed app. Otherwise, the system installs the app as unmanaged. If you reinstall a manged app and omit this value or set it to 'false', the app becomes unmanaged.
    For manifest-based installs, if 'true', the system only considers apps installed in '/Applications' as managed. In macOS 11 through 13, the system requires that the 'pkg' only contains a single signed app.
    Available in macOS 11 and later.

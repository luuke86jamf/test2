title: Managed Application Configuration Command
description: This command queries the device for the current configuration of managed
  applications. This command requires the App Management right. macOS supports this
  command as of 10.15, on the device channel and for User Enrollments only, because
  Settings->ApplicationConfiguration is supported. Since macOS does not support Managed
  Applications, this command can be used for any bundle identifier.

    The bundle identifiers of the managed apps.
    For a watchOS app, the identifier needs to be the watch's bundle identifier, which differs from the main bundle identifier for the iPhone to which the watch is paired. Obtain the watch's bundle identifier for an app with a watch bundle, in the 'watchBundleId' key that's part of the Content Metadata query. For more information on this query, see Getting App and Book Information (Legacy).

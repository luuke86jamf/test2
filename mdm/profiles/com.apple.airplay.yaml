      supportedOS:

      content: |-
        The device ID of the AirPlay destination in the format 'xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx'. This field isn't case-sensitive.
        The system limits the list of visible AirPlay destinations to devices that are present in the 'AllowList' field of all installed AirPlay payloads.
        Specifying the same MACAddress more than once, whether in the same payload across different payloads, results in undefined behavior.
        As of tvOS 18, 'DeviceID' isn't supported.

      supportedOS:

      type: <string>
      presence: optional
      content: |-
        The name of the AirPlay device.
        The system limits the list of visible AirPlay destinations to devices that are present in the 'AllowList' field of all installed AirPlay payloads.
- key: Passwords
  title: Passwords
  type: <array>
  presence: optional
  content: If present, sets passwords for known AirPlay destinations. Using multiple
    entries for the same destination, whether within the same payload or across multiple
    installed payloads, is an error and results in undefined behavior.

        The device ID of the AirPlay destination; used in macOS.
